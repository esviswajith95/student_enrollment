# Student enrollment status prediction

It is important for universities and other institutions(like banks which give student loans/ scholarships) to track the academic progress of students to provide them with better support and direction. The aim of the project is to predict the enrollment status of a student after the normal duration of his/her course.

A dataset created from a higher education institution (acquired from several disjoint databases) related to students enrolled in different undergraduate degrees, such as agronomy, design, education, nursing, journalism, management, social service, and technologies is used for the purpose. The dataset includes information known at the time of student enrollment (academic path, demographics, and social-economic factors) and the students' academic performance at the end of the first and second semesters.
